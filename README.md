# Description

I have created a SaaS WebApp where users can browse the different services and subscribe to multiple plans through the stripe payment gateway. In this project I have implemented the following things:
- SaaS plan with “Basic”, “Standard” and “Plus”
- List of the plans with details
- The services the user wishes to purchase can be stored/viewed in the cart.
- Checkout with Stripe integration with multiple subscription plans at once.
- User authentication through Login and SignUp pages.
- Checkout process where users enter their payment details.
- Super admin dashboard to manage the plans.
- Admin dashboard to manage the users.
